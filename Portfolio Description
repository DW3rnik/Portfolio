The Portfolio was created based on the Alex The Analyst 'Data Analyst Portfolio Project' series on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM&list=PLUaB-1hjhk8H48Pj32z4GZgGWyylqv85f).
The excel files are the raw data used for the project. All the code has been written by me.
The PowerBI report was inspired by Alex's video on Tableau. I have created it completely by myself to develop my PowerBI skills.
